# very-simple-monopoly-game
This is a very simple Monopoly game played in terminal.

I made this when I was learning programming.

This game has only been tested on the Ubuntu terminal. Game board drawing is not relative. There may be distortions in the drawing of the board. So zooming out the terminal may be needed.

## How to Compile

### `gcc game.c`

## How to Start

### `./a.out`
